# Together App - Complete Documentation

## üì± Overview

A modern React Native dating app built with Expo and Supabase, featuring individual and family account support.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Supabase account

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd togetherApp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment (see Environment Setup below)
# Set up database (see Database Setup below)

# Run the app
npm start
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Getting Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project (or create new one)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Copy:
   - **Project URL** ‚Üí `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon/public key** ‚Üí `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Run Migration Script

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `DATABASE_SETUP.sql`
4. Paste and run the script

This will set up:

- ‚úÖ Profiles table (with family account support)
- ‚úÖ User presence tracking
- ‚úÖ Conversations and messages
- ‚úÖ Likes and dislikes
- ‚úÖ All necessary RLS policies

### Step 2: Set up Storage (Optional)

For avatar uploads:

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create a new bucket called `avatars`
3. Make it **public**
4. Set up RLS policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow anyone to view avatars
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Profiles Table

```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- user_id: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
- full_name: TEXT
- gender: TEXT
- age: INTEGER
- bio: TEXT
- avatar: TEXT (URL)
- interests: TEXT[]
- account_type: TEXT ('individual' or 'family')
- is_active: BOOLEAN (which profile is currently active)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### Key Concepts

**Individual Accounts:**

- Has 1 profile where `user_id = auth.uid()`
- `is_active = true` for that profile

**Family Accounts:**

- Has multiple profiles where `user_id = auth.uid()` (same for all)
- Each profile has unique `id`
- Only one profile has `is_active = true` at a time
- Can switch between profiles

**Important:** All features (messages, likes, etc.) use `profile.id` not `user_id`!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Files

**Navigation:**

- `navigation/AuthStack.tsx` - Auth screens
- `navigation/MainTabs.tsx` - Main app tabs

**Contexts:**

- `contexts/ProfileContext.tsx` - Active profile management
- `contexts/ProfileRefreshContext.tsx` - Profile refresh trigger
- `contexts/OnboardingContext.tsx` - Onboarding state
- `contexts/ToastContext.tsx` - Toast notifications

**Services:**

- `services/supabaseClient.ts` - Supabase configuration
- `services/userService.ts` - All user/profile operations

**Main Screens:**

- `screens/DiscoverScreen.tsx` - Swipe cards
- `screens/LikeScreen.tsx` - View liked profiles
- `screens/ChatScreen.tsx` - Conversations list
- `screens/ConversationScreen.tsx` - Individual chat
- `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Edit profile
- `screens/FamilyDashboardScreen.tsx` - Manage family profiles

---

## üîê Security (RLS Policies)

All tables use Row Level Security to ensure:

- Users can only see/modify their own data
- Profile-based permissions work for family accounts
- Proper isolation between users

Example (Likes):

```sql
-- Users can like using any of their profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can like others"
ON likes FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  liker_id IN (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Auth session missing" error**

- User session expired
- Solution: Auto-handled by app, user will be redirected to sign-in

**2. "Row-level security policy violation"**

- RLS policies not set up correctly
- Solution: Re-run `DATABASE_SETUP.sql`

**3. "Duplicate key constraint violation"**

- Trying to insert duplicate data
- Solution: Check if record already exists, use upsert

**4. Profile switcher not working**

- Not a family account, or no other profiles
- Solution: Create additional family member profiles

**5. Messages not loading**

- Profile IDs not set up correctly
- Solution: Ensure all queries use `profile.id` not `user_id`

## üé® Customization

Edit `colors` in your components:

- Primary: `#FF6B6B` (pink/red)
